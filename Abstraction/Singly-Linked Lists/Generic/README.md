# First Exploration with Java Generics
* Things to look into
  * Cloning with generics
    * Seems to be a pain to do according to StackOverflow, as long as the class being used is immutable there isn't an issue 
    with multiple references to the same object because the object will never change. I haven't noticed any issues yet. Will
    investigate further
  * Tests in main with the extend method show unexpected results when playing around with references.
